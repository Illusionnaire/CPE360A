Classes and Objects let you structure your data in a conceptual level.
- Generally 3 questions: 
1. Attributes: What variables are within your class/object
2. Constructor: The default creation of your class/Objects
3. Functionality: What methods are created within your class/Objects

A Class teaches the compiler what that class should look like, do, contain, etc.
A class definition is created outside of any function, but does not make any cart.
