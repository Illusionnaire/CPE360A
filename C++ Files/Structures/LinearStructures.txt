Linear Structures:
- Stack (LIFO input/output)
- Queue (FIFO input/output)
- Linked List (no philosophy for input/output)

A stack inserts into the first position and also removes from the first position.
A queue inserts into the first position and removes from the last position.
A linked list allows you to insert and remove anywhere from the structure.
