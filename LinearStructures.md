Linear Structures:
> Stack (LIFO input/output)
> > A stack inserts into the first position and also removes from the first position. 
>
> Queue (FIFO input/output)
> > A queue inserts into the first position and removes from the last position.
>
> Linked List (no philosophy for input/output)
> > A linked list allows you to insert and remove anywhere from the structure.
