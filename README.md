COURSE SYLLABUS
1. Analysis of Algorithms: 
    * Time complexity
    * Space (storage) complexity
    * Big-O, small-O
    * theta notations

2. Solving problems using programming: 
    * Functions (modular programming)
    * Object oriented programming (classes/objects)
    * Recursion
    * Analyzing algorithms involving recursive forms using telescoping and substitution

3. Simple  (linear)  Data  Structures
    * Linked  lists
    * Doubly  linked  lists
    * Stacks  (push,  pop,  display)
    * Queues  (enqueue,dequeue, display)

4. Trees  (non-linear  data  structures)
    * Tree  definitions  and  properties
    * Tree  traversals  (pre-,  post-,  in-order)
    * Tree  operations(insert, delete)  
    * Expression trees (Prefix, Infix, Postfix)

5. Binary Search Trees
    * Lookup
    * Insert
    * Delete
    * Traversals

6. Priority Queues (PQ)
    * PQ using linked lists
    * Heap as a PQ

7. Advanced Data Structures (time permitting)
    * Self balancing trees, including Red Black Trees (creation) and AVL trees.

8. Sorting: 
    * Bubble sort
    * Quick-sort
    * Merge-sort
    * Insertion-sort
    * Heap-sort

9. Hash Tables
    * Hashing functions
    * Lookup using Hash Tables
    * Separate chaining
    * Linear probing
    * Quadratic probing
